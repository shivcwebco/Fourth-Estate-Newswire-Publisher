The Newswire Wordpress Publisher plugin enables news to be automatically sent from the Fourth Estate newswire to a subscriber's WordPress site.

== Description ==

The Newswire Wordpress Publisher plugin enables content to be automatically sent from the Fourth Estate's (www.fourthestate.org) newsroom management system to a subscriber's WordPress instance it's installed on.

When paired with an active Fourth Estate Newswire subscription, and a properly configured WordPress Newswire Publisher plugin, the news content is automatically published to WordPress. 

You can still log in to WordPress to administer the site and content as you normally would.


Based on the Superdesk WordPress plugin (https://github.com/superdesk/superdesk-wordpress-plugin)
Plugin updated and maintained by: Fourth Estate. Previous development by: Sourcefabric and AdminIT


== Installation ==

Install through the WordPress directory or download, unzip and upload the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can we change the allowed attributes and tags? =

A settings menu in WordPress lets you customize the way WordPress handles incoming content from the Fourth Estate Newswire.

For example, you can map categories to WordPress's tags, or use newswire subject codes as categories. Authors, copyright information, post status, and default categories are just some of the WordPress fields that can be configured from the Settings menu.
